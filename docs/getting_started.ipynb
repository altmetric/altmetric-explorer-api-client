    "The explorer API validates every request it receives by generating a cryptographic digest using the filters and a secret key associated with your account in Altmetric Explorer and comparing it to the value of the `digest` query parameter included with the request.  If the values are the same then a data response will be returned.  If not, then the API will respond with HTTP status `400 Bad Request`.\n",

    "This means you need to calculate the digest using the same method as the API server does when you create a request.  The process is quite involved (see the [documentation](https://www.altmetric.com/explorer/documentation/api#authentication) for more details) but the API client handles this part for you as long as you supply your api key and api secret when you create a new `Client` object.\n",

To do this, open the \"Secrets\" by clicking the key icon on the left hand side of the page and make new secrets named `API_KEY` and `API_SECRET` and add the values from from you account settings in Explorer.\n",

    "* There are 3 optional parameters that control how the request is handled:\n",
    "  - `order`: specify a field to order the results by.\n",
    "  - `page_size`: behind the scenes, the [Explorer API returns data in a sequence of pages](https://www.altmetric.com/explorer/documentation/api#pagination) so that you don't need to pull down every result every time you run a query.  The API handles this for you but you can control the size of the pages by setting the `page_size` parameter when you submit a query.  It defaults to 25.\n",
    "  - `page_number`: set this value if you want to start fetching data at a specific page.  The default is the first page.\n",
    "* All other parameters will be treated as filters to be applied to the data so you can find the results you are interested in\n",
    "  - Parameters with a single value will be submitted as a single query parameter\n",
    "  - Parameters with a list (or tuple, or set) will be submitted as separate array parameters in the request.\n",
    "  - For example, in the request above, the filters will be `filter[mention_sources_types][]=type:policy&filter[mention_sources_types][]=type:blog&filter[timeframe]=3d`\n",
    "* Technically, you could also supply your own `key` and `digest` as keyword arguments but this behaviour is not supported by the client and the results of doing so are undefined."
